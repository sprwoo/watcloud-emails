                In an ongoing effort to keep WATcloud's file storage efficient and maintain optimal performance, we routinely clean up specific directories that haven't been accessed in the past {daysForExpiry} days. We previously sent an email that you had files which met this criteria. Since they were not accessed by the given deadline, those files have been deleted.
